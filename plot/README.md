# Force-Displacement Curve Plotting

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for plotting force-displacement curves from experimental and simulation data stored in Excel and .rpt files.

## Notebooks

### 1. `graph_all_cond.ipynb`

This notebook reads multiple Excel files containing force and displacement data, pairs the corresponding columns, and generates plots for each temperature in all geometries.


### 2. [compare_all_curve.ipynb](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)

This notebook compares force-displacement curves from .rpt files and Excel files for each Temperature_StrRt_Orientation condition, then plotting them together for comparison.
